                    You can use any existing social media platform to advertise your project. We suggest putting out an interest survey to scout potential collaborators before committing to a new project.

                <div class="panel">
                    Publisher's Nexus is a planning and coordination tool meant to be a resource for self-publishers to be able to hit the ground running on their projects. It's non-profit and completely without ads. It is not meant to host finished products or help distribute them, only find ways for potential publishers to do so.
