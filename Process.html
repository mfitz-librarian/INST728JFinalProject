        </div>
            <div class="narrationCenter">
                <p> The first step to making your dream project a reality is to have an idea. <br>Likely, you already had this before even hearing about Publisher's Nexus.<br>Take this time to really consider what you'd like your project to look like and what audience you want to reach.</p>

            <div class="narrationCenter">
                <p>Most projects can't be done by yourself. <br>Even if you already have the skills, there's still the matter of time and equipment. <br> Don't feel the need to do everything yourself.<br>Reach out to those who might be interested in helping.</p>

            <p>With your new collaborators, discuss the method. <br> Plan out your project; look at your assets versus your vision. <br> Consider your timeline.<br>Consider your potential pitfalls.<br>Plan accordingly.</p></div>

            <div class="narrationCenter">
            <p>Now find your participants and your audience. <br>The people you found during Step Two &#40;The Call&#41; are going to be your moderators and managers; they're going to help guide the project to your vision. <br> The people you connect with here are going to be helping you with the actual legpower to getting there. <br>Writers, artists, and editors sign on at this stage.

                <p>Here's the bulk of the work: getting your content. <br>Words must be written. <br>Art must be made. <br> Revisions, corrections, and all the creative arguments that follow must happen. <br> Be patient.</p>

            <div class="narrationCenter">
                <p>Once the pieces are made, it's time to put them together. <br> Make sure you check in with your managers and moderators to ensure everything has gone according to plan thus far.<br> If you didn't invite an editor or layout artist on the project, hopefully your production company can provide one.</p>

                <p>Unless you have the equipment and supplies to manufacture your final product yourself, this step is largely out of your hands. <br>Turn your project over to the person or business who will finalize the product and cross your fingers.</p>

                <p>If your project is being sold or accepting donations, make sure you advertise well in advance &#40;perhaps during the various calling stages&#41;. <br> Don't wait until Step Eight to think about your financials; those things can get pretty tricky and very messy.<br>Keep your records clearly.</p>
